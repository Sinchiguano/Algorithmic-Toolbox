# Algorithmic-Toolbox and Sorting Algorithms with STL in C++!!!

The repository covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, and many others.
You will also find in this repository an example of how to sort and search data, how to break a large problem into pieces and solve them recursively, Everything is going to be done in c++...
Note: This is part of my self-learning, courses that I took from Coursera and Edx which are online learning platform related to Data Science. So without more ado, let's dive into the awesome world of C++!!!!!!
